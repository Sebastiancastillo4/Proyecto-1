# Apple Stock Volatility & Market Events Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between trading volume and daily stock volatility of Apple Inc., as well as the impact of key market events such as earnings announcements, Federal Reserve decisions, product keynotes, and dividend distributions.

The goal is to understand how both internal (company-specific) and external (macro-economic) events influence stock behavior.

## Objectives

* Measure the correlation between trading volume and daily volatility
* Compare volatility and volume on event vs non-event days
* Evaluate the impact of different event types:

  * Earnings announcements
  * Federal Reserve decisions
  * Product keynotes
  * Dividends
* Analyze temporal effects around events (before and after)

---

## Data Sources

* Historical Apple stock data (price, volume)
* Earnings calendar
* Federal Reserve event dates
* Apple keynote dates
* Dividend and stock split records

---

## Data Preparation

* Cleaned and standardized date formats
* Converted financial variables to numeric types
* Filtered data within a consistent time range (2020–2024)
* Merged multiple datasets by date
* Created binary variables for each event type

---

## Methodology

1. **Feature Engineering**

   * Daily volatility calculated as:
     `(High - Low) / Open`

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Time series visualization
   * Scatter plots (Volume vs Volatility)
   * Distribution comparisons

3. **Event Analysis**

   * Comparison of average volatility and volume:

     * Event days vs non-event days
   * Event-specific impact analysis

4. **Temporal Window Analysis**

   * Created ±N-day windows around events
   * Evaluated pre- and post-event behavior

---

## Key Findings

* Trading volume shows a **moderate relationship** with volatility
* Earnings announcements have the **strongest impact** on both volume and volatility
* Federal Reserve events also influence market activity, though to a lesser extent
* Product keynotes show **inconsistent effects**, suggesting lower direct market impact
* Volatility tends to increase not only on event days but also in surrounding periods

---

## Insights

* Market reactions are not always immediate; there is evidence of **anticipation and delayed response**
* Not all events have equal importance — distinguishing event types is crucial
* Volume alone is not a strong predictor of volatility, but it plays a supporting role

---

## Limitations

* Analysis is limited to one company (Apple Inc.)
* Event data is manually curated
* No predictive modeling was implemented

---

## Future Improvements

* Include additional companies for comparison
* Apply predictive models (e.g., regression, time series forecasting)
* Automate event data collection
* Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit or Tableau)

---

## Tools & Technologies

* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how combining financial data with real-world events can provide deeper insights into stock market behavior. It highlights the importance of context when analyzing volatility and trading activity.
